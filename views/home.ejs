          <h1>The Original Gerrymander</h1>
          <p>The term Gerrymandering refers to the act of manipulating the boundaries of voting districts to achieve some political advantage.<br>
          The term was coined during tenure Massachusetts Governor Elbridge Gerry, who in 1812 redrew the voting districts for the Massachusetts State Senate to favor his own party.<br>
          One district caught the attention of the Boston Gazette, who published a political cartoon likening the district’s shape to that of a salamander and labeling the phenomenon “The Gerry-mander” after the Governor.</p>
